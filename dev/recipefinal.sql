Add the cilantro leaves and about 3-4 Tbsp olive oil, the amount is really a preference of how loose or thick you like the pesto. Start with a little and add a little at a time until you reach the consistency of your preference. Stir in the juice of 1/2 a lime. If you are making this ahead of time...place in a bowl and drizzle just enough olive oil on top to coat, this keeps the air from getting to the cilantro. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.\nSaut the peppers with a drizzle of olive oil in a pan over medium high heat for just a couple minutes. Mix the peppers, corn and black beans in a bowl.\nLay out the egg roll wrappers. Smear some of the cilantro lime pesto on the end closest to you, leaving about an inch of the wrapper on the very end.\nAdd a spoon full of the veggies along the line of pesto. Brush the ends of the wrapper with water, this will help seal the egg roll. Fold the end nearest you over the veggies and the two\nsides fold in as well.\nRoll up the wrapper to the end. Place seam side down on a lined baking sheet that his been brushed with a bit of olive oil to prevent sticking.\nBrush the egg rolls lightly with olive oil as well, this will help get that golden color.

If the phone rings, let the answering machine pick it up. Cook roux until it has a dark mahogany color. Do not stop stirring until roux appears nutty or grainy.
